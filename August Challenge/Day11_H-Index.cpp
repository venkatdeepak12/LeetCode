/*

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

//Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(),citations.end());
        int first = 0;
        int mid;
        int count = citations.size();
        int step;
        
        while (count > 0) {
            step = count / 2;
            mid = first + step;
            if (citations[mid] < citations.size() - mid) {
                first = mid + 1;
                count -= (step + 1);
            }
            else {
                count = step;
            }
        }
        
        return citations.size() - first;
    }
};
